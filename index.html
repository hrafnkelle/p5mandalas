  <h2>Mandala generator</h2>
<p>
This is a Mandala generator sketch written in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
It also uses the [p5.vornoi library](https://github.com/Dozed12/p5.voronoi).
  </p>
  <p>
The concept is to generate a set of points on a circle, then regenerate new points on circles with the points from the previous iteration as centers. This is iterated a few times. A voronoi diagram of the resulting set of points is then the Mandala.
  </p>
  <p>
This was inspired by a [blogpost by Fronkonstin on generating Mandalas in R](https://fronkonstin.com/2018/02/14/mandalas/).
